## üìú Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a Code of Conduct that all contributors are expected to follow. Please read [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Basic understanding of terminal/command line usage

### Areas for Contribution

We welcome contributions in the following areas:

- üêõ **Bug fixes**
- ‚ú® **New features**
- üìö **Documentation improvements**
- üß™ **Test coverage**
- üé® **UI/UX enhancements**
- üåê **Internationalization**
- üì¶ **Package management**

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/tim.git
cd tim
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install in development mode with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### 4. Verify Installation

```bash
# Run tests to ensure everything is working
pytest

# Try running the application
python -m tim --help
```

## üîÑ Making Changes

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
# Create a new branch for your feature/fix
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-number
```

### 2. Branch Naming Conventions

- `feature/feature-name` - for new features
- `fix/issue-number` - for bug fixes
- `docs/section-name` - for documentation updates
- `refactor/component-name` - for refactoring
- `test/test-description` - for test improvements

### 3. Making Commits

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages:

```bash
# Examples
git commit -m "feat: add weekly summary command"
git commit -m "fix: handle timezone conversion properly"
git commit -m "docs: update installation instructions"
git commit -m "test: add tests for streak calculation"
```

#### Commit Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=tim

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_commands.py

# Run tests matching a pattern
pytest -k "test_streak"
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Name test files with the pattern `test_*.py`
- Use descriptive test function names
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Mock external dependencies (database, file system, etc.)

#### Example Test

```python
def test_add_tag_success(mock_db):
    """Test that add_tag creates a new tag successfully."""
    result = runner.invoke(app, ["add-tag", "Python"])
    assert result.exit_code == 0
    assert "Added tag:" in result.stdout
```

### Test Coverage

We aim for at least 80% test coverage. You can check coverage with:

```bash
pytest --cov=tim --cov-report=html
# Open htmlcov/index.html in your browser
```

## üé® Code Style

### Formatting and Linting

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black** - Code formatting
- **isort** - Import sorting
- **flake8** - Linting
- **mypy** - Type checking

These run automatically with pre-commit hooks, but you can also run them manually:

```bash
# Format code
black tim/ tests/

# Sort imports
isort tim/ tests/

# Lint
flake8 tim/ tests/

# Type check
mypy tim/
```

### Style Guidelines

#### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/)
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black's default)
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes

#### Example Function

```python
def calculate_streak(sessions: List[Session], tag: str) -> int:
    """Calculate current streak for a specific tag.
    
    Args:
        sessions: List of completed sessions
        tag: Tag name to calculate streak for
        
    Returns:
        Number of consecutive days with activity
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If tag is empty or None
    """
    if not tag:
        raise ValueError("Tag cannot be empty")
    
    # Implementation here
    return streak_count
```

#### Documentation Style

- Use [Google Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) docstrings
- Include type information in docstrings
- Provide examples for complex functions
- Keep README and other docs up to date

### Rich/Terminal UI Guidelines

- Use consistent colors from the Catppuccin palette
- Ensure text is readable in both light and dark terminals
- Include proper spacing and alignment
- Use appropriate Rich components (Tables, Panels, etc.)
- Test UI changes in different terminal sizes
